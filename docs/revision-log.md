# Revision Log

Historical and migration-oriented notes live here so feature docs can stay focused on current behavior.

## DA-008: `docs/09-advanced-effects.md` cleanup

- Removed inline references to legacy terminology in the advanced-effects guide.
- Replaced legacy logging examples with current `Tell` usage.
- Removed references to non-spec state APIs from that guide in favor of `Get`/`Put`/`Modify`.
